# python-api-challenge

In this project we were able to work with two different files. We worked with a weather API and also a Cities API applying everything learned through out the course. We were able to obtain a lot of information that any person planning a future trip would like to know like humidity, cloudiness, max temperature and hotels within a radius of the cities matching a specified criteria.
